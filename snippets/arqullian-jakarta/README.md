# Camunda Platform Process Application
A Process Application for [Camunda Platform](http://docs.camunda.org).

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-ejb-war-7.21.0](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-applications/maven-archetypes/).

## Show me the important parts!
[BPMN Process](src/main/resources/process.bpmn)

## How does it work?

## How to use it?

### Arquillian Test
You can run the JUnit test [ProcessTest](src/test/java/com/camunda/consulting/it/ProcessUnitTest.java) in your IDE or using:

##### when you do not have a running wildly, download one and runs in target folder
```bash
mvn clean test -Pwildfly-managed
```
##### when have a running configured wildly

```bash
mvn clean test -Pwildfly-remote
```

### Deployment to an Application Server
You can also build and deploy the process application to an application server.
For an easy start you can download WildFly with a pre-installed Camunda
from our [Download Page](https://downloads.camunda.cloud/release/camunda-bpm/wildfly/).

#### Manually
1. Build the application using:

```bash
mvn clean
```
2. Copy the *.war file from the `target` directory to the deployment directory
of your application server e.g. `wildfly/standalone/deployments`.
For a faster 1-click (re-)deployment see the alternatives below.

#### WildFly (using WildFly Maven Plugin)
1. Build and deploy the process application using:

```bash
mvn clean wildfly:deploy
```


### Run and Inspect with Tasklist and Cockpit
Once you deployed the application you can run it using
[Camunda Tasklist](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#tasklist)
and inspect it using
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).

## Environment Restrictions
Built and tested against Camunda Platform version 7.21.0 on WildFly 27+ Application Server.
