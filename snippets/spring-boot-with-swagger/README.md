# Camunda Spring Boot Application
Spring Boot Application using [Camunda](http://docs.camunda.org).

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-spring-boot-7.15.0](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-applications/maven-archetypes/).

## Show me the important parts!
This is just a generic Spring Boot application with a SwaggerUI. The pom has been updated to include the Swagger and Open API jars from the repo
```
    <dependency>
		<groupId>org.camunda.bpm.run</groupId>
		<artifactId>camunda-bpm-run-modules-swaggerui</artifactId>
		<version>7.15.0</version>
	</dependency>

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.camunda.bpm</groupId>
		<artifactId>camunda-engine-rest-openapi</artifactId>
	<version>7.15.0</version>
	</dependency>
```
The Camunda Application class has been updated to permit CORS. Start the application and you're done!

mvn clean package spring-boot:run
```

#### Your Java IDE
1. Run the project as a Java application in your IDE using CamundaApplication as the main class.

### Run and Inspect with Tasklist and Cockpit
