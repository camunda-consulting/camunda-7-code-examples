          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store
          custom Java objects) should be deserialized on server side (default true).

          If set to true, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and
          transformed to JSON using [Jackson's](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) POJO/bean
          property introspection feature. Note that this requires the Java classes of the
          variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to false, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string
          containing XML.

          **Note**: While true is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we
          recommend setting this parameter to false when developing web applications that are
          independent of the Java process applications deployed to the engine.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store
          custom Java objects) should be deserialized on server side (default true).

          If set to true, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and
          transformed to JSON using [Jackson's](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) POJO/bean
          property introspection feature. Note that this requires the Java classes of the
          variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to false, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string
          containing XML.

          **Note**: While true is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we
          recommend setting this parameter to false when developing web applications that are
          independent of the Java process applications deployed to the engine.

        as the process definition, the deployed image will be returned by the Get Diagram endpoint.
        Example: `someProcess.bpmn` and `someProcess.png`.
        Supported file extentions for the image are: `svg`, `png`, `jpg`, and `gif`.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store
          custom Java objects) should be deserialized on server side (default true).

          If set to true, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and
          transformed to JSON using [Jackson's](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) POJO/bean
          property introspection feature. Note that this requires the Java classes of the
          variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to false, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string
          containing XML.

          **Note**: While true is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we
          recommend setting this parameter to false when developing web applications that are
          independent of the Java process applications deployed to the engine.

        Queries for the number of process instances that fulfill the given parameters.

        therefore it is slightly more powerful than the Get Instance Count method.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store custom Java objects)
          should be deserialized on server side (default true).

          If set to true, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and transformed to JSON
          using [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean property introspection feature.
          Note that this requires the Java classes of the variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to false, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string containing XML.

          Note: While true is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we recommend setting this parameter to false
          when developing web applications that are independent of the Java process applications deployed to the engine.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store custom Java objects)
          should be deserialized on server side (default true).

          If set to true, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and transformed to JSON
          using [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean property introspection feature.
          Note that this requires the Java classes of the variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to false, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string containing XML.

          Note: While true is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we recommend setting this parameter to false
          when developing web applications that are independent of the Java process applications deployed to the engine.

        Queries for tasks that fulfill a given filter. This method is slightly more powerful
        than the [Get Tasks](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/reference/rest/task/get-query/) method because it
        allows filtering by multiple process or task variables of types `String`, `Number`
        or `Boolean`. The size of the result set can be retrieved by using the
        [Get Task Count (POST)](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/reference/rest/task/post-query-count/) method.

        **Security Consideration**:
        There are several parameters (such as `assigneeExpression`) for specifying an EL
        expression. These are disabled by default to prevent remote code execution. See the

        [security considerations for custom code](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/user-guide/process-engine/securing-custom-code/)

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store
          custom Java objects) should be deserialized on server side (default true).

          If set to true, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and
          transformed to JSON using [Jackson's](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) POJO/bean
          property introspection feature. Note that this requires the Java classes of the
          variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to false, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string
          containing XML.

          Note: While true is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we
          recommend setting this parameter to false when developing web applications that are
          independent of the Java process applications deployed to the engine.

        Completes a task and updates process variables using a form submit. There are two
        difference between this method and the `complete` method:

        * If the task is in state `PENDING` - i.e., has been delegated before, it is not
        completed but resolved. Otherwise it will be completed.
        * If the task has Form Field Metadata defined, the process engine will perform backend
        validation for any form fields which have validators defined.

        [variable scopes and visibility](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/user-guide/process-engine/variables#variable-scopes-and-variable-visibility).

        **Note**: If a variable doesn't exist, the variable is created in the top-most scope
        visible from the task.

            Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store custom Java objects)
            should be deserialized on server side (default `false`).

            If set to `true`, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and transformed to JSON
            using [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean property introspection feature. Note
            that this requires the Java classes of the variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

            If set to `false`, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format. For example, a
            variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string containing XML.
