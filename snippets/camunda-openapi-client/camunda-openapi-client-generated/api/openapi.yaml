          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically
          variables that store custom Java objects) should be deserialized
          on server side (default `true`).

          If set to `true`, a serializable variable will be deserialized on
          server side and transformed to JSON using
          [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean
          property introspection feature. Note that this requires the Java
          classes of the variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to `false`, a serializable variable will be returned in its
          serialized format. For example, a variable that is serialized as
          XML will be returned as a JSON string containing XML.

          **Note:** While `true` is the default value for reasons of
          backward compatibility, we recommend setting this parameter to
          `false` when developing web applications that are independent of
          the Java process applications deployed to the engine.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that
          store custom Java objects) should be deserialized on server side (default
          `true`).

          If set to `true`, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side
          and transformed to JSON using
          [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean property
          introspection feature. Note that this requires the Java classes of the
          variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to `false`, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized
          format. For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as
          a JSON string containing XML.

          **Note:** While `true` is the default value for reasons of backward
          compatibility, we recommend setting this parameter to `false` when developing
          web applications that are independent of the Java process applications
          deployed to the engine.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically
          variables that store custom Java objects) should be deserialized
          on server side (default `true`).

          If set to `true`, a serializable variable will be deserialized on
          server side and transformed to JSON using
          [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean
          property introspection feature. Note that this requires the Java
          classes of the variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to `false`, a serializable variable will be returned in its
          serialized format. For example, a variable that is serialized as
          XML will be returned as a JSON string containing XML.

          **Note:** While `true` is the default value for reasons of
          backward compatibility, we recommend setting this parameter to
          `false` when developing web applications that are independent of
          the Java process applications deployed to the engine.

          Variable filtering expressions are comma-separated and are structured as follows:
          A valid parameter value has the form `key_operator_value`. `key` is the variable name, `operator` is the comparison operator to be used and `value` the variable value.

          **Note:** Values are always treated as String objects on server side.

          Valid operator values are: `eq` - equal to; `neq` - not equal to; `gt` - greater than; `gteq` - greater than or equal to; `lt` - lower than; `lteq` - lower than or equal to; `like`.

          Key and value may not contain underscore or comma characters.

        because it allows filtering by multiple process variables of types `String`, `Number` or `Boolean`.

          Variable filtering expressions are comma-separated and are structured as follows:
          A valid parameter value has the form `key_operator_value`. `key` is the variable name, `operator` is the comparison operator to be used and `value` the variable value.

          **Note:** Values are always treated as String objects on server side.

          Valid operator values are: `eq` - equal to; `neq` - not equal to; `gt` - greater than; `gteq` - greater than or equal to; `lt` - lower than; `lteq` - lower than or equal to; `like`.

          Key and value may not contain underscore or comma characters.

        Queries for user operation log entries that fulfill the given parameters.
        The size of the result set can be retrieved by using the

        method.

        Note that the properties of operation log entries are interpreted as
        restrictions on the entities they apply to. That means, if a single
        process instance is updated, the field `processInstanceId` is
        populated. If a single operation updates all process instances of the
        same process definition, the field `processInstanceId` is `null` (a
        `null` restriction is viewed as a wildcard, i.e., matches a process
        instance with any id) and the field `processDefinitionId` is
        populated. This way, which entities were changed by a user operation
        can easily be reconstructed.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that

          If set to `true`, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side
          and transformed to JSON using

          If set to `false`, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized
          format. For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as
          a JSON string containing XML.

          **Note:** While `true` is the default value for reasons of backward
          compatibility, we recommend setting this parameter to `false` when developing

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that
          store custom Java objects) should be deserialized on server side (default
          `true`).

          If set to `true`, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side
          and transformed to JSON using
          [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean property
          introspection feature. Note that this requires the Java classes of the
          variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to `false`, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized
          format. For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as
          a JSON string containing XML.

          **Note:** While `true` is the default value for reasons of backward
          compatibility, we recommend setting this parameter to `false` when developing
          web applications that are independent of the Java process applications
          deployed to the engine.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store
          custom Java objects) should be deserialized on server side (default true).

          If set to true, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and
          transformed to JSON using [Jackson's](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) POJO/bean
          property introspection feature. Note that this requires the Java classes of the
          variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to false, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string
          containing XML.

          **Note**: While true is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we
          recommend setting this parameter to false when developing web applications that are
          independent of the Java process applications deployed to the engine.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store

          If set to true, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and
          transformed to JSON using [Jackson's](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) POJO/bean
          property introspection feature. Note that this requires the Java classes of the
          variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to false, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string
          containing XML.

          **Note**: While true is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we
          recommend setting this parameter to false when developing web applications that are
          independent of the Java process applications deployed to the engine.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store
          custom Java objects) should be deserialized on server side (default true).

          If set to true, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and
          transformed to JSON using [Jackson's](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) POJO/bean
          property introspection feature. Note that this requires the Java classes of the
          variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to false, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string
          containing XML.

          **Note**: While true is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we
          recommend setting this parameter to false when developing web applications that are
          independent of the Java process applications deployed to the engine.

          Variable filtering expressions are comma-separated and are structured as follows:

          `operator` is the comparison operator to be used and `value` the variable value.

          **Note**: Values are always treated as String objects on server side.

          Valid `operator` values are:
          `eq` - equal to;
          `neq` - not equal to;
          `gt` - greater than;
          `gteq` - greater than or equal to;
          `lt` - lower than;
          `lteq` - lower than or equal to;
          `like`.
          `key` and `value` may not contain underscore or comma characters.

          Variable filtering expressions are comma-separated and are structured as follows:

          A valid parameter value has the form `key_operator_value`. `key` is the variable name,
          `operator` is the comparison operator to be used and `value` the variable value.

          **Note**: Values are always treated as String objects on server side.

          Valid `operator` values are:
          `eq` - equal to;
          `neq` - not equal to;
          `gt` - greater than;
          `gteq` - greater than or equal to;
          `lt` - lower than;
          `lteq` - lower than or equal to;
          `like`.
          `key` and `value` may not contain underscore or comma characters.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store custom Java objects)
          should be deserialized on server side (default true).

          If set to true, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and transformed to JSON
          using [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean property introspection feature.
          Note that this requires the Java classes of the variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to false, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string containing XML.

          Note: While true is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we recommend setting this parameter to false
          when developing web applications that are independent of the Java process applications deployed to the engine.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store custom Java objects)
          should be deserialized on server side (default true).

          If set to true, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and transformed to JSON
          using [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean property introspection feature.
          Note that this requires the Java classes of the variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to false, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string containing XML.

          Note: While true is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we recommend setting this parameter to false
          when developing web applications that are independent of the Java process applications deployed to the engine.

        Queries for tasks that fulfill a given filter. This method is slightly more powerful
        than the [Get Tasks](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.16/reference/rest/task/get-query/) method because it
        allows filtering by multiple process or task variables of types `String`, `Number`
        or `Boolean`. The size of the result set can be retrieved by using the
        [Get Task Count (POST)](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.16/reference/rest/task/post-query-count/) method.

        **Security Consideration**:
        There are several parameters (such as `assigneeExpression`) for specifying an EL
        expression. These are disabled by default to prevent remote code execution. See the
        section on
        [security considerations for custom code](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.16/user-guide/process-engine/securing-custom-code/)

        **Security Consideration:** There are several query parameters (such as
        assigneeExpression) for specifying an EL expression. These are disabled by default to
        prevent remote code execution. See the section on
        [security considerations](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.16/user-guide/process-engine/securing-custom-code/)

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store custom Java objects)
          should be deserialized on the server side (default `true`).

          If set to `true`, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and transformed to JSON
          using [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean property introspection feature.
          Note that this requires the Java classes of the variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to `false`, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string containing XML.

          Note: While `true` is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we recommend setting this
          parameter to `false` when developing web applications that are independent of the Java process
          applications deployed to the engine.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store custom Java objects)
          should be deserialized on the server side (default `true`).
          If set to `true`, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and transformed to JSON
          using [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean property introspection feature.
          Note that this requires the Java classes of the variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to `false`, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string containing XML.

          Note: While `true` is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we recommend setting this
          parameter to `false` when developing web applications that are independent of the Java process
          applications deployed to the engine.

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store custom Java objects)
          should be deserialized on the server side (default `true`).

          If set to `true`, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and transformed to JSON
          using [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean property introspection feature.
          Note that this requires the Java classes of the variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to `false`, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string containing XML.

          Note: While `true` is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we recommend setting this
          parameter to `false` when developing web applications that are independent of the Java process
          applications deployed to the engine.

          Valid operator values are: `eq` - equal to; `neq` - not equal to; `gt` -
          greater than;
          `gteq` - greater than or equal to; `lt` - lower than; `lteq` - lower than or

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that
          store custom Java objects) should be deserialized on server side (default
          `true`).

          If set to `true`, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side
          and transformed to JSON using
          [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean property
          introspection feature. Note that this requires the Java classes of the
          variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to `false`, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized
          format. For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as
          a JSON string containing XML.

          **Note:** While `true` is the default value for reasons of backward
          compatibility, we recommend setting this parameter to `false` when developing
          web applications that are independent of the Java process applications
          deployed to the engine.

          Valid operator values are: `eq` - equal to; `neq` - not equal to; `gt` -
          greater than;
          `gteq` - greater than or equal to; `lt` - lower than; `lteq` - lower than or

          Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store custom Java objects)
          should be deserialized on server side (default `true`).

          If set to `true`, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and transformed to JSON
          using [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean property introspection feature.
          Note that this requires the Java classes of the variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

          If set to `false`, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format.
          For example, a variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string containing XML.

          **Note:**  While `true` is the default value for reasons of backward compatibility, we recommend setting this
          parameter to `false` when developing web applications that are independent of the Java process
          applications deployed to the engine.

            The array consists of objects with the three properties `name`, `operator`
            and `value`.
            `name (String)` is the variable name, `operator (String)` is the comparison
            operator to be used and `value` the variable value.
            `value` may be `String`, `Number` or `Boolean`.

            Valid operator values are: `eq` - equal to; `neq` - not equal to.

            Determines whether serializable variable values (typically variables that store custom Java objects)
            should be deserialized on server side (default `false`).

            If set to `true`, a serializable variable will be deserialized on server side and transformed to JSON
            using [Jackson's](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) POJO/bean property introspection feature. Note
            that this requires the Java classes of the variable value to be on the REST API's classpath.

            If set to `false`, a serializable variable will be returned in its serialized format. For example, a
            variable that is serialized as XML will be returned as a JSON string containing XML.
