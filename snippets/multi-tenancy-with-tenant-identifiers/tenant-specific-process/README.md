# Camunda BPM Process Application
A Process Application for [Camunda BPM](http://docs.camunda.org).

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-servlet-war-7.5.0](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-applications/maven-archetypes/).

## How does it work?

Deploy a process for a single tenant by specifying the tenant ID in the `process.xml` deployment descriptor.

## How to use it?
Deploy the process application using maven and check if the definition is only available for the specified tenant as well as for members of the group camunda-admin.

You can also use `ant` to build and deploy the example to an application server.
For that to work you need to copy the file `build.properties.example` to `build.properties`
and configure the path to your application server inside it.
Alternatively, you can also copy it to `${user.home}/.camunda/build.properties`
to have a central configuration that works with all projects generated by the
[Camunda BPM Maven Archetypes](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-applications/maven-archetypes/).

Once you deployed the application you can run it using
[Camunda Tasklist](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#tasklist)
and inspect it using
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).
