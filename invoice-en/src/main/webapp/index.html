							<li>Form: enter data and finish task</li>

	  				In the last task a subversion system (SVN) is called in order to archive the PDF file. This only works if in the class "PDFTOSVNDelegate" an existing SVN has been provided and the credetials have been entered correctly.
	  				</p>
	  				<p>
	  				Even if there is no SVN, the process can be run through without a problem until the last user task before the SVN call.

							</p>
							<p>
							In the template, a variant of twitter bootstrap is referenced, adapted to the fox tasklist, in order to align the design of the forms to the desing of the fox tasklist. This approach can also be used to implement your own corporate design.

							<p>At the end of the process the PDF file is filed in a subversion (SVN). In BPMN this is a service task which itself points to the Java class "PDFToSVNDelegate". Here all the process variables are read and the SVN system is called.</p>
							<p>As you can see, via this very simple approach the whole range of Java can be used. One could also easily implement a link to other systems within this delegate.</p>

							The CDI integration of the fox engine is used quite often in this application, e.g. in order to start aprocess instance out of the servlet, which can be called up from the start form ("StartByUpload").
							</p>
							<p>
							The example shows how quick and easy even very individual requirements for your process applications can be realized through CDI integration.

							This function demonstrates the process diagramm API, with which one can view an image file of the deployed process and also gets a 'coordinate system" which is based on the layout information of the exported BPMN 2.0-XML. By this means the function can be combined with any BPMN 2.0-conform tool.
							</p>
							<p>
							Built in this, with the help of CCS and Javascript ( (JQuery, Twitter Bootstrap and other functions) the named features are implementet in this example.
							</p>
							<p>
							The example shall show how easy and flexible your own and solution-specific runtime information on the process can be inserted into an on business-side understandable process diagramm.
